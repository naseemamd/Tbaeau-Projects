The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Analysis project leverages Tableau to explore and visualize data related to FDI flows across various countries and industries. FDI is a critical indicator of global economic health and serves as a key driver of international trade and economic development. This project aims to provide insights into FDI trends, patterns, and impacts using interactive visualizations.

**Key Components:
**
Data Collection:

Gathered FDI data from reputable sources such as World Bank, UNCTAD, IMF, or national statistical agencies.
Utilized data scraping tools or APIs to automate data retrieval process.
Data Preparation:

Cleaned and transformed raw FDI data using tools like Python (Pandas) or R to prepare it for analysis.
Merged multiple datasets to enrich FDI data with additional variables such as GDP, population, sector-specific information, etc.
Tableau Visualization:

Developed a series of interactive dashboards and visualizations using Tableau Desktop.
Visualized FDI inflows and outflows over time across different countries and regions.
Analyzed FDI distribution by sector, industry, and investment type (greenfield vs. mergers & acquisitions).
Created geographical maps to visualize FDI hotspots and investment destinations.
Implemented drill-down features to allow users to explore detailed FDI data at various levels of granularity.
Statistical Analysis:

Conducted statistical analysis to identify correlations and trends within the FDI dataset.
Employed regression analysis, time series analysis, or clustering techniques to uncover insights.
Integration with Other Tools:

Integrated Tableau with statistical analysis tools like R or Python using TabPy or Rserve for advanced analytics.
Utilized Tableau's Web Data Connector to fetch real-time FDI data from online sources.
Exported Tableau visualizations to PowerPoint or PDF for report generation and presentation purposes.
GitHub Repository:

Created a GitHub repository to host project files, including Tableau workbooks, data preparation scripts, documentation, and any additional resources.
Organized repository structure with descriptive README.md files explaining project overview, data sources, methodology, and instructions for replicating analyses.

**Goal**:
Provide stakeholders with actionable insights into FDI trends and patterns.
Facilitate evidence-based decision-making for policymakers, investors, and economic analysts.
Demonstrate proficiency in data visualization, analytics, and tool integration through a real-world project.
